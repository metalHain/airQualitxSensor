this is the readme file for our study project of devoloping an atmega328p based air quality
measuring unit.

aim is to devolop an intuitive user interface where you can move through different pages seeing
measured values and a plot. measured values are temporarily saved on atmega and commited to a 
micro sd card. which can be then post processed via matlab or python
